[![Visit Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Visit-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=netlify)](https://smarttrafficmanager.netlify.app/)



**A real‑time, AI‑powered dashboard to monitor and optimize urban traffic flow.**

---

## 📌 Overview

Smart Traffic Manager is a web app designed to visualize and manage live traffic data—vehicle counts, wait times, congestion heatmaps, alerts, and more. It’s an edge‑to‑cloud traffic analytics tool that helps city planners, engineers, and transport authorities make data‑driven decisions for intelligent traffic control.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- **Real‑time vehicle counting and congestion visualization**  
- AI‑based detection of traffic density, wait times, and violations  
- Adaptive signal‑timing recommendations (inspired by adaptive traffic control systems)   
- Intuitive and responsive UI built with modern frontend frameworks  
- Deployable on Jamstack platforms like Netlify for quick, scalable deployment 

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React/Vue/Angular (your pick), CSS/SCSS, D3.js or Chart.js for visualizations  
- **Backend (optional):** Serverless functions (Netlify Functions/AWS Lambda) for analytics  
- **Data & AI:** Integration with live traffic sensors or CCTV feeds; OpenCV or TensorFlow.js for computer vision capabilities
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Netlify—fast builds, CDN, instant previews

## ✅ Benefits & Impact

* **Reduced congestion:** Adaptive timing can cut delays by \~25–30% vs fixed signals ([time.com][1])
* **Improved safety:** Near real‑time alerts for violations like red‑light running, speeding
* **Scalable:** Built on adaptive control concepts already successfully used in progressive systems ([en.wikipedia.org][2])
